# Abstract - Abstract Algebra Java Library

Abstract algebra objects (set, monoid, group, ring) as hierarcical Java objects. 

Set element mapping rule and operations are defined in a class which extends Ring class. Category of the defined object can be checked with isRing method.

See Hilbert method as an example:

Let t be fixed non-negative integer. Then h(t) denotes the set of integers of the form nt + 1 as n ranges over Z+. One observes that integer multiplication endows h(t) structure of a commutative monoid with unit 1.
Hilbert class is a generalization of h(t) where Hilbert(t,s) denotes the form nt + s.
