# Abstract - Abstract Algebra Java Library

Abstract algebra objects (set, monoid, group, ring) as hierarcical Java classes. 

Set element mapping rule and operations are defined in a class which extends Ring class. Category of the defined object can be checked with isRing method.

See Hilbert method as an example:

Let t be fixed non-negative integer. Then h(t) denotes the set of integers of the form nt + 1 as n ranges over Z+. One observes that integer multiplication endows h(t) with a structure of commutative monoid with unit 1.
Hilbert class is a generalization of h(t) where Hilbert(t,s) denotes the form nt + s. It also has an addition operation which operates over cardinality (n) in order to ensure closure.

First 100 irreducible elements of h(t) for t = 1 to 10
